                    I stared at our picture, the one we took when we went to Ghana at Kakum National Park. The picture where I wore an oversized red gown that hid my petite body. The picture revealed your dimples as you smiled, your smile reached your eyes, unlike that night.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    You loved me first, but I loved you more. My love was strong and real but you suddenly changed. You smiled too much at your phone, ignored my calls and claimed you were busy. That was when I knew you were cheating on me. I asked but you denied it. You denied it so much and I hated you for it.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I found out about the person you were cheating on me with. Her name was saved as Fiyin with three heart emojis and one ring. Mine was only saved with one emoji. That was the only confirmation I needed.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    That night, I made sure I cooked your favourite meal, fondled with your beards and when we made love, you looked at me like I was the only one in your life. That was when I made my final decision.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    You were fast asleep when I woke you up gently. "Why are you not sleeping, love?" You asked. "Who is Fiyin?" I stared into your eyes as I asked in return. You seemed puzzled and before you could speak, blood rushed out from your mouth. I had stabbed you, not once, not twice, and I watched as you bled to death.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    No one knew I killed you. You told no one about me. I wish I could kill you one more time. Still, I attended your burial and saw Fiyin there. She came out to read her tribute for you and as she finished, she ended it with, "Fiyin, your cousin."
