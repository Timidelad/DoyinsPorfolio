                    It happened in 2019. I meant the accident that scarred my face. As I got out of school, I decided to remove my glasses and walk without them. I wasn't totally blind, you know. I could see clearly, but perhaps I thought wrong. I walked home alone after bidding my friend goodbye. "Look right, look left, look right again." I know this so well, I've been crossing this road for four years.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    But I forgot that phrase, I only looked right. It was only a road made for vehicles coming from the right side. So, why bother looking left? I forgot this is Nigeria, some rules don't count.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    And because I ignored the rules no one followed, I lost consciousness and found myself in the hospital. I had gotten hit by a bike coming from the left side. The right side of my face was torn from where my eye ended. I probably would have been blind from broken pieces if I had been wearing my glasses. The wound was stitched up, and I had a new face, one I wasn't familiar with.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    "At least you are not dead, be grateful," I tell myself. But this wasn't the face I grew up with, I had to learn to live with it. I had to tell the same person that spoke with me just yesterday that it was an old scar. I mean, you still saw me yesterday, and you are asking me what happened to my face today? But it's no one's fault, it's just that my scar hides itself from people and suddenly pops up even when they've known me all along.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I was never insecure about it, not now, not ever. It's just that I feel one of my eyes is slightly bigger than the other, but no one has ever agreed with me on that. I feel like a fool while trying to prove it through pictures. It's so obvious, but they say they can't see it. Am I the problem? Or am I actually insecure?
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    Almost five years now, the scars look faded, but they still keep asking me, "What happened to your face?" I'll probably answer this question for the rest of my life. Most times, I just smile and say it's an old scar. 
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    It really is an old scar, but I still find it uncomfortable to sleep on the right side of my face. I still unconsciously turn my face to the left side while taking pictures. I still fear crossing the road. And no, I'm not insecure, it's just that... I can't explain it.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I feel good about my scar, it's like a badge of honour, lol... I mean, I could have left you all in this lonely world. But yet, I'm here by the mercy of God to make you feel less lonely, less seen, more better, and more happier.
                </div>
                <div>
                    To be truthful, I know I am beautiful with it, but it's just that sometimes, I look in the mirror, and I can't help but say, "Ahh God dey create! Cos Doyin, o ti fine juu... kilode?" (Translation unavailable).
