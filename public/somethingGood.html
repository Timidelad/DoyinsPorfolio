                <div class="mb-4">
                    It was raining heavily, just the way it had rained in 1999. The raindrops on the corrugated sheets were so loud. It felt like it would tear and the house would be flooded. The only difference was that there was no lightning. There was no wind. The buckets outside were full and started running out.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I went into the room and I tucked in Fola who was already half asleep in my hands. I guess there would be no school for him today. I myself doubted if I would go to the shop. It had started raining since 6am and it was almost 9am.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    On rainy days like this, It was hard not to think about that day. I left the room and I walked to the sitting room. I dropped my phone on the table and I sat down as my mind wandered to years back. It finally stopped in 1999.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    It was the morning of July 23, 1999. I had woken up to the sound of the rain. My eyes were still closed as I traced the bed with my hand. I felt something missing and I opened my eyes almost immediately. My wife was not by my side. She wouldn't be outside, it was raining. Maybe she was in the kitchen or in the bathroom.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I raised myself up, sitting on the bed. I couldn't stand up immediately like I used to. I had an accident two months ago and I had injured my legs. My crutches were beside the bed. I stretched my hands as I took them. With no rush, I stood up and I leaped with my crutches, calling my wife's name at the same time. She would probably be in the kitchen, I thought to myself after I had checked the bathroom and saw that she was not there. I went to the kitchen, she wasn't there either. I searched the whole house, but I couldn't find her.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    "Where could she be?". I started to panic.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I finally settled down on the chair, in the sitting room. I was still thinking of where she could have gone to early in the morning. I was more disturbed by the rain. My eyes caught something. I was not sure if it was there before. Something prompted me and I got up to check it. I got up gently, moved to the table and I took it. It was a letter. It was inside a white envelope. I tore it open, not thinking twice. It was a letter from my wife. 
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p>Dear AJ,</p>
                    I hope this letter finds you in good shape. By now, I would be at the airport or I might have finally left the country. I'm sorry for leaving you like this but you and I know we can't work. Someone has to make the first move. Who would want toâ€¦..
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    The letter fell from my hand and I almost lost my balance. I couldn't finish reading it. I leaned on my crutches with all my strength. I knew something was wrong between us but I had never imagined she would leave me. I thought it was the accident that created the barrier between us. But still, she cared for me. And I had assumed she was just tired of the stress. I must have missed the signs.I didn't know where the energy came from as I dashed inside to take an umbrella and I went out leaving my crutches behind.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I didn't know the rain was so heavy until I was outside but I didn't mind. I must get to the airport. The lightning had become intense, there was a great wind too. The umbrella I was holding was fighting to free itself from my hand.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p>"I must see her before she leaves"</p>
                    <p>"What about our promises?"</p>
                    <p>"How could she do this to me?"</p>
                    <p>"Did she go with a rich man?"</p>
                    <p>But I'm not poor. Even though the accident had taken a lot from us. We still had something. I questioned myself on what could have gone wrong.</p>
                    <p>"Why did she leave?" If there was a reason, maybe I would feel better. But I could not think of anything and that fact was hurting me. I couldn't even hate her, I hated myself. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    The umbrella finally freed itself. I couldn't care any less. The rain was beating me but I could not feel anything. I felt something coming out from my eyes but I convinced myself that it was the rain. I wasn't crying, it was definitely the rain. "Please, don't leave yet", I pleaded in my mind.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    The rain had become more heavier. The thunderstorms were getting intense. The road was getting blurry in my eyes. It was then I finally accepted that I had been crying. There was no bus. The road was empty. I didn't notice I was the only one on the road.
                    <p>"What a day!"</p>
                    <p>I reduced my pace. I finally stopped and I wept.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    The rain washed my tears and I felt void. I didn't know what to do but I resumed walking. "I would get to the airport. I might still see her", I gave myself a little hope. I bent my head down as I walked. I saw something in the gutter. My mind dismissed it. Then I stopped again. Reflexively, I turned back and I stared for a while into the gutter. I became frozen when what I saw finally registered in my brain.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I saw a small creature in the gutter wrapped with heavy woolen cloth. It was a baby. The baby's face was pale. For a while, I forgot my own problems. I wondered how the baby got there. I picked up the baby. It was a girl. She was so small and vulnerable. The rain had beaten her. If there was a flood, she would have been washed away. I wasn't sure if she was still breathing. But the way I felt her in my hands, I knew I had to do something.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I'm still not sure what happened to my legs that day but I ran to the hospital with the baby clutched in my hands. The nurses had hurriedly taken her from my hand and attended to her. They thought I was her father so I told them everything that happened, skipping my own part of going to the airport. It wasn't their business, anyway. They didn't probe further and they seemed to believe me. It was one of the nurses that called my attention to my leg. It had become swollen. It was then that I started feeling severe pain and my legs started to shake.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I had forgotten that I was drenched too and I started shivering. I felt weak and the hospital started moving in circles. I had to be admitted too. My wife crossed my mind but I know she would have been long gone. It was hard to accept and I closed my eyes and dived into unconsciousness
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    Two days later, I felt better and I left the hospital. The baby was still there. Her case was reported to the police but no one came to claim her. I didn't check on her either. I couldn't go back to the house as it reminded me of my wife. I went to stay at a friend's house. I didn't tell any of my family she had left but when they later found out, they didn't say anything.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I constantly went to the hospital for a check up on my legs. It had gotten better but I would have to visit the hospital for five more months. I still didn't not bother to check on the child. I had simply forgotten.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    "Sir, the baby would be leaving for motherless babies home today. No one came to claim her. Do you want to see her?", one of the nurses asked me during one of my regular check ups. I nodded and I followed her as she took me to where the baby was.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I saw her. She wasn't the same tiny baby. She smiled at me as I held her hands. Her eyes were full of life. "Thanks for saving her". The nurses said aloud and in that moment I realised what I had done. Even though, I had lost what was mine. I saved a life. Probably the best thing I've ever done in my life. It took me a while before I let go of her hand
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    t had been a month after the baby had left. I had been uncomfortable and restless. My friend had told me to move on. He said that life goes on. But surprisingly, I wasn't that bothered about my wife. It was something else. I decided to get back to work and return to my house but I felt something was missing. I could not forget that day. The day I held her hands. The way she smiled at me. It keeps resurfacing in my head. I tried to ignore it but it became worse.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I carried my bag to go to the motherless babies home. I didn't tell anyone about it except the nurse. I had gone to the hospital first and I told the nurse I would like to adopt the baby. She agreed to go with me to the motherless babies home. When we got there, I was lucky no one had adopted her yet. I was asked some questions and told to fill a form. Maybe because I found her, they were really happy to give her to me.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    Right on the spot, I named her Rere. It means "something good".
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I left with Rere in my hands with her small bag and my own bag. I left for my house.The responsibility dawned on me as soon as I stepped into the house. But I promised myself that I would do anything to take care of the child. She would be mine. I dropped the bags immediately I entered and I sat down with Rere on my laps. I saw the letter on the table and an almost forgotten pain flashed through me. I stood up to take the letter to read again.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p>Dear AJ</p>
                    <p> hope this letter finds you in good shape. By now, I would be at the airport or I might  have finally left the country. I'm sorry for leaving you like this but you and I know we can't work. Someone has to make the first move. Who would want to be with a man that cannot father a child?
                    I'm sorry for not fulfilling my promise to stand with you for better and for worse. Our ship would later sink, so I might as well get off now. Don't hate me too much. I sincerely wish you the best.</p>
                    <p>- Jemima</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p>"What does she mean by that?"</p>
                    <p>"What's going on?"</p>
                    <p>"Why can't I father a child?" Those questions rang in my head. Then everything started to make sense. The accident had affected me. I can no longer father a child. That was why my family could not say anything when she left. That was why my friend could not say too much. "Do they think I know and saying it would hurt me more or were they trying to keep it from me?"</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    I was losing my mind slowly when Rere tears jolted me back into reality. The reality of everything dawned on me. With tears in my eyes, I rocked her to sleep.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Fola's cries brought me back to the present. He cries whenever he wakes up and sees no one. I stood up from where I sat and I went to the room. The rain had stopped. I carried my three years old grandson. His mother had left him with me for about three months now. He stopped crying as I threw him up to catch him, he started to laugh. "More", he pleaded. And I threw him up and caught him once more. I went to the sitting room with him holding and flunging my hands. My phone rang. Fola brought it to me from the table where it was. It was from Rere, my daughter.
