            Mama said "vengeance belongs to the Lord, the creator of all
            humans". If I were human, I would have agreed with Mama, but on that
            very night, I became a monster.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            "I trust the God I serve, he will never go scot free". Then the God
            she served should have wiped off my memory, or at the very least,
            made sure he never crossed my path. Instead, he brought him my way.
            Not only him, but also his wife and three adorable kids. As if that
            wasn't enough, he became a pastor. Tell me, how can God punish a man
            who now serves him diligently? So, I'll do it for Him just this one
            time. The rest, I'll leave to Him.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            How do you forgive a man that raped your sister till she bled to
            death? A man who killed your soul, destroyed your life, and made you
            barren due to his many beatings? You forgive him and move on?
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">----------</div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Eight years had passed since it happened, and seven years since
            Mama's death. I had shut out the world. My neighbour, whom I barely
            spoke to, often slipped church pamphlets under my door. I never read
            them, I never came to her church either, but she didn't stop.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            That day, for the first time, I read one before tossing it in the
            bin. It spoke of peace. It didn't exactly move me, but it was Mama's
            death anniversary, and I remembered her last words, "Leave him, live
            your life and find peace." Perhaps I'd find peace in the house of
            God. Maybe I'd feel human again. So, I went to church that Sunday.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            It was my first time in eight years, and permit me to say; God has a
            sense of humour. As I sat down, I saw Marcus on the podium, holding
            a microphone. The universe is cruel, isn't it? It has its way of
            mocking you.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            I stood still on my seat, as hurtful memories surfaced in my head,
            and I tried to shut down all the events that had happened, that had
            led me here but yet it came like as if it happened just yesterday,
            and I remembered when it all started.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            It was Saturday, exactly 10am, I was walking down the aisle in my
            dream gown, the one he had picked for me, for my wedding, for our
            wedding. I could see his handsome face from afar, though the veil
            blurred it slightly. Mama smiled, her lips curved with pride. I had
            made her proud. I had not become like her without a husband as the
            rumours say.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Everything happened so fast; the songs, hymns, my sister wiping
            tears from her eyes in excitement, I tried to shake off the memory
            of her crying for it felt like an irony, an irony of things to come.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            I tried to move to another memory, I landed on another one that
            happened before Chima's death. I was cooking, my eyes swollen, my
            hair scattered, I stirred the stew with the little strength I had
            left. Then he came in, he started an argument. I remained silent. I
            wasn't ready for it, the pain of the previous beating was still
            there, so I kept quiet and ignored him, but my silence enraged him
            more and he turned me to himself and slapped me. I hadn't expected
            it, I thought staying silent would keep him calm. Tears welled up in
            my eyes, "I'm sorry", I gasped, though I didn't even know what I'd
            done wrong.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Another memory; Chima had moved in with us. She got admitted into a
            programme near our place. I had pleaded with Mama to let her rent a
            place, I even offered to pay for it, but she did not understand. My
            husband didn't want to hear any of it after I had told him, "do you
            want me to tell my mum that you said she cannot come?", I had asked
            him. Of course, that led to another beating, "you want to paint me
            black? He yelled while beating me.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Two days later, Chima had shown up at our place with the biggest
            smile after I had told Mama all the possible reasons she shouldn't
            come. I remembered her running to meet her brother in law to hug
            him. He was so happy to see her that I thought he had changed his
            mind. I smiled as I closed the door. And I closed Chima's chapter in
            my heart, for it haunted me the most.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            The rest of the memories were blurry. Blood, more blood, my sister,
            his eccentric laughter, a sharp kick, the hospital, Mama's death.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            And now, here he was, preaching forgiveness. Preaching how Christ
            forgave and loved us while we were yet sinners.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Maybe I would have forgiven him if he hadn't looked so happy, if his
            three kids had'nt run to meet him screaming "Daddy!". If he had
            recognised me when I met him after the service. If he hadn't
            introduced me to his wife as a first timer. If only I saw a tiny bit
            of recognition in the eyes of the man who had been my husband for 10
            years.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            "To err is human, to forgive is divine." Exactly. Only God can
            forgive him, not me.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            On the day I killed Marcus, I entered his office, and he smiled.
            "Welcome, did you book an appointment? This was supposed to be my
            rest hour". "I lied that I was your sister and was told to come in".
            I replied with a dry smile. He straightened up.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            "Marcus Lawrence", I said as I pulled a chair to sit. "I see you are
            doing the Lord's work." "What do you want, Dera?" he asked. He
            remembers my name. He remembers me. The hurt swelled in my chest.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            "I want you," I said sardonically. He smiled and said as he stood
            up, "as you can see, I'm not the same man I used to be." "And what
            happens to the life you led?" I asked, uninterested in his self
            righteous speech. "That is my past," he said. Oh? And the people you
            hurt with your past? Who gave you the right to be happy?" My voice
            rose. But I remembered people were around. So I caught myself and
            lowered it."Who gave you the right to be happy?"
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            He came nearer. His face was sorry. For a bit, I was scared I
            wouldn't be able to carry out while I came here. He looked like one
            who would fall to his knees and beg, but instead, he said, looking
            me straight in there eyes, "Dera, old things have passed away,
            behold all things have become new". He held my shoulder. "You too
            can come to this new life and let go of your past and bitterness."
            Bewildered, I shook his hand off me, stood up, and then I laughed
            bitterly, he stared at me in confusion.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            "What do you want? Money? I have money." He offered. That was it, I
            could not take it anymore. I pulled out the gun. He moved backward,
            towards the door, frightened and surprised. "Dera, don't kill me and
            bring this sin upon your head," he pleaded. "Marcus, this new life
            you talk about, does it not say to die is to live?" He fell silent.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            I screamed hard in anger, "you dare call me by name and preach to
            me? You raped my sister, and it led to her death. Mama died soon
            after, I lost my womb, I lost five pregnancies, the trauma of the
            beatings still remains. I have nightmares every night. You ran away
            after it all to start a new life. Then you preach to me after
            ignoring who I was that day. A new life? I don't want! I am long
            dead."
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Please, let's talk this through, sweat beading on his face. It
            pleased me. I knew people were coming because of the noise, I could
            hear rushing footsteps, Marcus's heavy breathing and his pleadings,
            but my chest hardened. I hated him. Before the door was opened…
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Two gunshots rang out. One for Marcus, one for me.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            As I drowned into unconsciousness. I could hear a voice saying,
            "Thankfully, the bullet didn't hit me. I don't know her. If she
            survives, she must be arrested!" I remember Mama's words. "Vengeance
            belongs to the Lord."
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            Tell Mama I didn't wait for God, I did it on my own, but maybe it
            was in vain.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-4">
            I closed my eyes shut, forever lost in oblivion.
